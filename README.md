Searchlight Inefficient Compression Scheme

This repository was created to answer an interview question.

## How To
Two versions have been provided:
* compression_demo.py
* compression_demo_no_pytest.py

The first is recommended and the second is provided in case there is an issue using pytest (e.g. if you do not have a copy installed, or if your version has been configured to use custom test names).

Tests can also be run by navigating to the correct folder and entering 'pytest' into the command line.
