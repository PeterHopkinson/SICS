Searchlight Inefficient Compression Scheme

This repository has been created to answer an interview question.

Code is provided unlicensed on the understanding that it will not be used beyond the current interview process.

## How To
Two versions have been provided:
* compression_demo.py
* compression_demo_no_pytest.py

The first is recommended and the second is provided in case there is an issue using pytest (i.e. if you do not have a copy installed, or if your version has been configured to use custom test names).

Tests can also be run by navigating to the correct folder and entering 'pytest' into the command line.
